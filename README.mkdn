SomethingJelly
==============

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with SomethingJelly, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/download/using-repo).

To initialize your local repository using the SomethingJelly trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/SomethingJelly/android.git -b sj4.2.1

Then to sync up:

    repo sync -j# (# is the number of cores in your computer x2)

Thanks to CyanogenMod for the README template.
